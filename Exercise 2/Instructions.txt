Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and converst the temperature to degrees Celsius.
Then, prompt the user to enter a temperature in Celsius and convert the temperature to degrees Fahrenheit.
The formulas needed are: C = (F - 32) * 5/9 and F = 9/5 * C + 32

Here's a sample run of the program with user input show:
Enter a Fahrenheit temperature: 100
100F is equivalent to 37.777C

Enter a Celsius temperature: 100
100C is equivalent to 212F
