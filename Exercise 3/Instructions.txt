Write a "guessing game" program that generates a random integer between 1 and 10000, inclusive.
The program should prompt the user for a guess.

For each guess the program will output: 
'HIGHER' if the user's guess is lower than the target
'LOWER' if the user's guess is higher than the target
'WINNER' if the user guesses the target

Each time the program prompts the user for a new guess, it should calculate and display the elegible range of values
